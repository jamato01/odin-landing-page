# odin-landing-page
TOP's Landing Page Project, allowing me an opportunity to work on my HTML/CSS skills and build a website's landing page from scratch.

## Pre-Project Reflection
This is a pretty daunting task, but I believe my fundamentals in HTML and CSS have been taught to me well by TOP. I spent quite a bit of time working through every example and extra resource, so I should be able to figure this one out without any help.

## Post-Project Reflection
I am actually really happy with what I've been able to produce here. I think despite not knowing best practices for making a lot of the layout of the page work, I was able to find what I believe are the best ways to do so. I think the best part of my project is my HTML. I am not sure if I used *all* of the proper elements for what the content on the page is, but I think the structure I used is solid. The low part would probably be my stylesheet. I feel like I classed everything almost individually and have a bunch of different selectors in a row. I tried to cascade down what I could, but due to the different sections being so varied in style I didn't do a lot of cascading (I considered using a "dark" and "light" class but figured there were not enough elements that would use them). If anyone has feedback on this, or any other part of my project, please let me know and I will do my best to update it!
