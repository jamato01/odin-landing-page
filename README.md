# odin-landing-page
TOP's Landing Page Project, allowing me an opportunity to work on my HTML/CSS skills and build a website's landing page from scratch.

## Pre-Project Reflection
This is a pretty daunting task, but I believe my fundamentals in HTML and CSS have been taught to me well by TOP. I spent quite a bit of time working through every example and extra resource, so I should be able to figure this one out without any help.
